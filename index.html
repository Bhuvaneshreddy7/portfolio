                    <h3> A WI-FI BASED SMART WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK FOR MONITORING AN AGRICULTURE CLIMATE CONTROL USING [  IOT ] 
                        TECHNOLOGY.</h3>
                        Growing up in a family of farmers, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges and hardships that come with agricultural  practices. <br>
                        My father, like many other farmers, has struggled with monitoring crops due to limitations in technology and  resources.<br> This project 
                        is motivated by the desire to ease the burden on farmers by harnessing the power of IoT to create  a smart solution for agriculture 
                        monitoring.  <br>
                       <br><h3> Objectives: </h3> 
                        <p>1. Design and develop a WiFi-based smart wireless sensor network capable of monitoring key environmental parameters  
                        such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity.  </p>
                        <p>2. Implement a user-friendly interface for farmers to access real
                        time data and receive alerts on their crops' conditions.  </p>
                        <p>3. Conduct field trials to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of the 
                        system in real-world farming scenarios. </p> 
                        <p>4. Provide training and support to farmers for the adoption and integration of the 
                        technology into their farming practices</p>

                    <h3>   REGISTRATION FORM TO SIGN UP AND STORE USER INFORMATION USING HTML,CSS,NODE.JS IN MONGODB</h3>
                    <p> Developed a comprehensive registration form using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB.<br>  <br>Created responsive, user
                        friendly interfaces and implemented client-side validation.<br> <br> Utilized Node.js and Express to build backend APIs for handling form 
                        submissions and processing data securely. <br> <br>Integrated MongoDB for efficient data storage and management.<br>  <br>Enhanced user 
                        experience through AJAX form submission and real-time feedback.<br> <br> Demonstrated strong skills in full-stack development, from 
                        designing front-end interfaces to implementing robust backend systems
                    <h3> Objective :</h3>
                    <p> The objective is to create a user registration form using HTML and CSS for front-end design, with a Node.js server handling the back-end logic. The form will capture and validate user information, then securely store the data in a MongoDB database. This setup ensures efficient user management and data persistence for web applications.</p>
